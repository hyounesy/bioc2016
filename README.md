# Making R packages accessible to non-programmers using the VisRseq framework

This repository contains the course materials for the [Bioconductor 2016 workshop](http://bioconductor.org/help/course-materials/2016/BioC2016/).

## Abstract
The goal of this workshop is to introduce the [VisRseq](http://visrseq.github.io) framework and walk through the quick process of creating modules called R-apps from R packages. This is specifically useful for bioinformaticians and developers that would like to make their R packages accessible to their non-programmer collaborators or to the public without having to spend significant time on creating extensive graphical user interfaces. 

I will walk the participants through several examples of creating diverse types of apps, from simple plotting (e.g. ggplot) to intermediate (e.g. clustering) to more advanced (e.g. edgeR and DEseq) packages. I will also show how several R-apps can be linked together to create more complex workflows. 

## Requirements
Participants will require having beginner/intermediate knowledge of R and a machine with R and Java installation.
